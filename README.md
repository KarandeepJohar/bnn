# 15-769 Fall 2016 assignment 2.

In this assignment you will implement a simple DNN inference and
training framework, and optimize the performance of your
implementation to achieve high performance on either a CPU or a GPU.

Using your framework you will be able to evaluate popular networks
(such as VGG-16 or Inception) to perform image classification tasks,
or train your own networks. The goals of the assignment are to get
basic experience implementing basic DNN layers described, as well as
optimizing their implementation for modern parallel architectures.
The assignment will also provide the experience of training a DNN for
an image classification task.

Please see the course web site for a detailed description of building and
running this code.
